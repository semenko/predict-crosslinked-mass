# Predict-Crosslinked-Mass

This script is designed to help in determining protein-protein interactions, by predicting the mass of
crosslinked peptide fragments following an enzymatic digestion of a protein complex.


## Crosslink Types

There are three types of crosslinks predicted by the program:

1. "Orphan" crosslinks, e.g. protein1peptide + linker
2. "Internal" crosslinks, e.g. protein1peptide + linker + protein1peptide
3. Desired, cross-protein links, e.g. protein1peptide + linker + protein2peptide
